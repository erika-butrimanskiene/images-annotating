# images-annotating-application

Hi,

I've deployed page (backend on heroku, frontend on netlify), so you can check it within this link - https://images-annotating.netlify.app

Also, you can download code and run it by these steps:
1.Download code;
2.go to cd frontend, then run commands: 2.1. npm install (install node modules), 2.2. npm start (to run React project) 
3.go to cd server, then run commands: 2.1. npm install (install node modules), 2.2. nodemon (to run backend) 

Then type image url and check this application ;)
